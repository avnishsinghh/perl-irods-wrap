=head1 NAME

WTSI::NPG::DriRODS - A drop in replacement for WTSI::NPG::iRODS that
replaces all it data- and metadata-changing methods with logging
stubs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class enables dry-run operations to be carried on iRODS out more
easily. Simply replace your iRODS handle with an instance of this
class and all the method calls that would change data and/or metadata
will be logged at INFO level, along with their arguments.
